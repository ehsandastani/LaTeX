Let's skip how awesome LaTeX is since you can look up its benefits yourself. But what might be hard to figure out through searching is how to actually use it for your work. So, without any extra chatter, let's start the tutorial in general terms and dive deeper as we go!

First off, you gotta install a TeX distribution, like TeX Live (which is cross-platform), MiKTeX (for Windows), MacTex (for Mac), etc. After that, you can go ahead and install an editor for it! Since my work relies on Windows :'), I use TeXStudio myself.

\end{document}
